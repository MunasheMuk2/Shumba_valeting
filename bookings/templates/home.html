      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <p>
        Here are some answers to commonly asked questions about mobile valeting.
      </p>
      <button class="accordion">Do I need to provide parking?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Yes. While our teams are more than happy to clean your car wherever
          you are, they will need sufficient space to complete the job. Please
          ensure thereâ€™s room for our professionals to work.
        </p>

      <button class="accordion">Do I have to provide water?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          The majority of our onboarded washers will provide water for your
          valet or detail. However, there maybe some who will require access to
          water. You can filter your results to only show operators who provide
          water.
        </p>
      </div>
      <button class="accordion">Can I leave a review for my car washer?</button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Yes! We encourage every customer to leave a review after your car
          wash.
        </p>

      <button class="accordion" id="third">
        Do I have to provide electricity?
      </button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          No, we will provide power for your valet or detail. However, there
          maybe the odd exception when we may require access to electricity.
