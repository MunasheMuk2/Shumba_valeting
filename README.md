## üõ†Ô∏è Development Process

- **Version control**: Git & GitHub.  
- **Commit messages**: Small, descriptive, documenting progress.  
- **Process followed**:  
  1. Planning (wireframes, schema design, UX goals).  
  2. Setup (Django project, models, apps, templates).  
  3. Implementation (CRUD, forms, feedback).  
  4. Styling (CSS branding, responsive grid).  
  5. Testing (manual and validation).  
  6. Deployment (local + Heroku).  

---

### Solved bugs

1. Although I had created a superuser locally, I had to recreate the superuser on heroku so the admin panel could show up 

2. The booking form was showing an error like "Select a valid choice" for the package or time slot, even when the options looked right. Amended the packages to make sure they were in the data base, made sure the timeslots were being correctly passed into the form and updated mismatch between my local code and Heroku by updating  models and running migrations properly. (This issue came up because Heroku wasn't deployed on time‚ÄîI had to wait for my GitHub Student Pack to get free credits for hosting.)

---

### Unsolved bugs

1. Attempted to have a pop up alert message when there is a duplicate booking but site kept generating a message on the booking for due to the Django auto generated message from errors. Had to resort to using javascript within the home.html where the form is selected to scroll to the form on error. However the issue with the pop up message still stands as won't work.

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shumba-valeting.git
cd shumba-valeting
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate      
pip install -r requirements.txt

##  Remote Deployment (Heroku)

- Deployed with **Heroku**, using **PostgreSQL** as the database.  
- `Procfile` and `requirements.txt` included for deployment.  
- Environment variables managed in **Heroku Config Vars**.  
- `DEBUG = False` in production for security.  

## Remote Deployment after project completion (Heroku) 
Deployment delays (waiting for GitHub Student Pack credits)

* Step 1: Make Migrations Locally
* Step 2: Push Code to Heroku
* Step 3: Run Migrations on Heroku
* Step 4: Create a Superuser on Heroku
* Step 5: Sync Data (Packages & Time Slots)
